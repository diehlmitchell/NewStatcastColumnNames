# NewStatcastColumnNames
Here is what I would do if I had been in charge of making the column names for the statcast data. 

Use this by copying the file and importing it: 

```
from StatcastSearchColumns import PitchingStats

# (in order to use the events column)
PitchingStats.events # is"events" 
```
